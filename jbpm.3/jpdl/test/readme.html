<h1>Test Project Purpose</h1>

<p>This subproject of jpdl contains a test suite that is to be ran inside of 
the jboss container.  This is to test pieces of jPDL that cannot be tested in 
plain unit tests like e.g. JMS messaging, ejbs, container transactions, ...
</p>

<p>The main artifact of this project is a web application.  That web application
must be deployed to jboss.  After that is done, tests can be ran inside of a 
client junit testrunner as you normally do in your IDE (e.g. eclipse).
</p>

<p>In the client test runner, cactus will be configured to talk to a servlet 
in the web application.  That servlet will execute the tests inside of the 
container and report back the results to the client.  For more information on 
this setup, see the apache jakarta cactus documentation.
