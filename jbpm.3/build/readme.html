<h1 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h1>
<h3>Create user properties</h3>
<p>
In your ${user.home} (e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\tom) create a directory
called <code>jbpm</code> with a file called <code>build.properties</code>.  Use 
this file to overwrite and customize the jBPM properties for your specific 
situation.
</p>

<p>You should walk through the <code>build.properties</code> in this directory
to see which properties you should customize.  The first part of this file contains 
the properties that are typically customized and those are marked.
</p>

<h3>Get the jBPM dependencies</h3>
<p>
In this directory, execute <code>ant get.dependencies</code>.  That will 
fetch the jbpm required libraries from the jboss repository and puts it in your local 
repository.
</p>

<h3>Get the ant dependencies</h3>
<p>
In this directory, execute <code>ant install.ant.libs</code>.  That will 
copy the clover.jar and junit.jar from the local repository to the <code>${ant.home}/lib</code>
directory.  Before using this target, make sure that you update the ant.home property 
in the build.properties in this dir or preferably in your <code>${user.home}/jbpm/build.properties</code>
</p>

<h3>Get docbook support</h3>
<p>
In this directory, execute <code>ant get.docbook.support</code>.  For most builds 
this is not required.
</p>

<h1 id="jbpmprojectstructure">jBPM project structure</h1>
<p>
There are two types of projects: 
<ul>
  <li>Artifact projects that produce exactly 1 artifact (e.g. identity, jpdl/jar, jpdl/db, ...)</li>
  <li>Module projects that group a number of child projects (e.g. jpdl, jboss, enterprise)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The structure of the artifact projects is inspired by maven.  Yet still 
we think it is easier and more convenient for the jbpm developer community
to keep ant as the central build system.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>src/main/java</td>
    <td>Application/Library sources</td>

<p>
The motivation for having the top level build in a separate build 
directory is to enable that jbpm modules are being loaded into an 
IDE in separate projects.
</p>

<h1 id="versioning">Versioning</h1>
<p>
Each top level module (e.g. console, enterprise, identity, jpdl, ...) has 
a version.
</p>
<p>Dependencies between different jbpm projects are always passed via the 
local repository.  IMPORTANT NOTE: the version number given to produce a jbpm 
artifact is defined separate from the inter-jbpm dependency versions.  
</p>
<p>
The version of the artifacts that are being produced is defined in the 
<code>version.properties</code> file located in the module directory.
E.g. <code>jpdl/version.properties</code>
</p>
<p>
The version of the jbpm artifacts that is being used to build other jbpm 
artifacts is defined in the <code>build/build.properties</code>.  Section 
<code>"USED jBPM ARTIFACT VERSIONS"</code>
</p>


<h1 id="eclipse">Eclipse</h1>
<p>
To get the build path right in your eclipse environment, you 
need to set the <code>JBPM_REPO</code> class path variable to 
your local repository.
To set your classpath variable, navigate:  
'Window'-->'Preferences'-->'Java'-->'Build Path'-->'Classpath Variables'
</p>
<p>
You can import the jbpm.3 module as an eclipse project.
</p>
<p>
As an alternative, you can also import a subset of the directories 
in the jbpm.3 module as eclipse projects.
</p>

<h1 id="buildfiles">Build files</h1>
<p>The <code>build.xml</code> in this directory contains all global jbpm targets.
E.g. a <code>'clean'</code> target that calls the clean target on all the module projects. 
A <code>'build'</code> target that calls the default target on all the module projects.
A <code>'get.dependencies'</code> that will downloads the dependencies from the remote repository
and stores them into the local repository.
</p>

<p>
For the module build files, the <code>base.project.build.xml</code> build file 
in this directory is the 'mother' of all project build files.  This contains 
the basic ant targets. Each project has it's <code>build.xml</code> file that 
imports the <code>base.project.build.xml</code>.
</p>

<p>
The project's build file will read properties from the files 
<code>${user.home}/jbpm/build.properties</code> and <code>build/build.properties</code>.
So the sequence of properties being read is 
<ol>
  <li>Properties defined the project's <code>build.xml</code> file</li>
  <li>Properties read from the <code>${user.home}/jbpm/build.properties</code></li>
  <li>Properties read from the <code>build/build.properties</code></li>
</ol>
As you know, in ant, the first definition of a property wins.
</p>

<p>
Apart from overriding and customizing properties, also targets of the imported 
<code>base.project.build.xml</code> file can be overwritten in the project build file.
</p>

<h1 id="repository">Repository</h1>
<p>
All dependencies are resolved from a local repository.  By default the 
location is <code>${user.home}/jbpm/repository</code>
</p>

<p>
The local repository is a subset of the remote repository.  The remote 
repository is <a href="http://repository.jboss.com">http://repository.jboss.com</a>
and can be accessed via http and an ordinary web browser.  
</p>

<h3>Getting the dependencies into your local repository</h3>
<p>
The <code>get.dependencies</code>
target in <code>./build.xml</code> will fetch the dependencies via the ant get 
task.  It will fetch the library dependencies into your local repository via http.
</p>
<p>
The configuration properties for customizing the repository are specified in 
<a href="./build.properties">./build.properties</a> and can be overwritten in 
your <code>${user.home}/jbpm/build.properties</code>.  By default, the 
local repository will be <code>${user.home}/jbpm/repository</code>.
The property <code>'local.repository'</code> specifies the absolute path of 
your local repository and the <code>'lib.xxx.version'</code> property 
specifies the version for library xxx.
</p>

<h3>Adding a dependency to the repository</h3>
If you need to add a library dependency to jBPM, please proceed as follows

<ol>
  <li>
    Find the library in <a href="http://repository.jboss.com">http://repository.jboss.com</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (1/4): VERSIONS' in <a href="./build.properties">./build.properties</a> 
    and add the version dependency for your library.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (2/4): REPOSITORY LOCATION PROPERTIES' in that same <a href="./build.properties">./build.properties</a> 
    and add the local and remote repository locations similarly as is done for the other libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (3/4): BUILD CLASSPATH' in <a href="./base.project.build.xml">./base.project.build.xml</a> 
    and add the library to the default build classpath.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (4/4): UPDATE LOCAL REPOSITORY' in <a href="./build.xml">./build.xml</a> 
    and add the library to the <code>'get.dependencies'</code> target.
  </li>

</ol>

<h3>Publishing a jBPM artifact to the repository</h3>
<p>
Publishing a jBPM artifact should not be done without consideration.  Especially the 
jBPM artifacts that are not SNAPSHOTS should only be published during a release.
</p>

<p>
To publish a jBPM artifact to the remote repository, use the target <code>'publish'</code>.
</p>

<p>
The publish target will only work if you have executed the '<code>checkout.jbpm.repository</code>'
once so that there is CVS information available in the jbpm part of the local 
repository.  Before the <code>publish</code> target is executed, the presence of the   
CVS information is verified and you get an appropriate error message.
</p>

<p>
Another requirement is that you have developer access to the jboss CVS repository and that you 
have configured your command line cvs client with the proper authentication information.
</p>

<h1 id="docbook">Docbook</h1>
<p>To generate the documentation, you need the jboss docbook module. The simplest 
way to get it is with the <code>get.docbook.support</code> target in 
<a href="./build.xml">./build.xml</a>
</p>
<p>The directory in which docbook-support should be placed and used can be configured in 
<a href="./build.properties">./build.properties</a>, key <code>docbook.support.dir</code>
</p>
<p>To make the docbook-support location configurable, we had to include the dtd
in the userguide module so that it could be referenced locally.  The dtd and 
all the dependent files are located in <code>../jpdl/userguide/dtd</code>
</p>
